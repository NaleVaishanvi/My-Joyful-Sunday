        <p id="p" > A VERY GOOD MORNING ‚ú®. <BR><br>I woke up at 7 AM, even though I really wanted to stay in bed a little longer. But since it was Sunday, I decided to make it the joyful day of my life ‚ú®. I finally pushed myself to get up, stepped onto the balcony, and breathed in the fresh morning air.<br>The sky was beautiful , and the birds were chirping üé∂. watching the sunrise and gatting the first light of day, making the day look even more beautiful, but the building blocked the view of the sunrise. Even so, the calm atmosphere made me feel peaceful and excited about the day ahead. <br>I brushed my teeth, took a refreshing bath, and picked out a nice outfit for the day. Feeling ready and full of energy, I set out to explore new places and make great memories!‚ú®</p>

        <p id="para0" >My friends and I reached the crowded PMPML stand and quickly got on a bus from Alandi to Manpa. <br>The bus was packed and their are no seat are empty for seating. After getting on the bus, Arati gave me her earbuds to listen to songs. She always carries her earbuds with her. Listening to music always lifts my mood and makes me feel better. It's amazing how music can make a long journey feel short and more enjoyable! While Listening music i was thinking about the place and all the things I wanted to do there. </there><br></p>
